# Online-Grocery-Store
The Online Grocery Store System, OGSS, developed to give grocery businesses a dedicated online system where customers can shop at their own convenience. The system gives both customers and delivery drivers a real-time dashboard where they can view pending deliveries and their status. New orders are automatically assigned to the drivers with an even distribution algorithm.
